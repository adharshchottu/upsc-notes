**_Resources are generally defined as all those things available in man's physical environment on which he depends for the satisfaction of some want or the other._**

**W. A. Lewis** states _"the level and pattern of development of a country is often limited by its natural resources"_

## Land resources

The **National Forest Policy Resolution** of the Government of India in 1952 recommended that considering the need for ecological balance, the country should have one-third of land as forest cover. But we are not able to reach the target even now.

The land that is not available for cultivation is of two categories. _land put to non-agricultural uses_ and _barren land_. Over the years barren land was reduced and due to population pressure some uncultivable land was made cultivable. Land with trees and groves has been reduced and replaced by agriculture. Agriculture land increased over the years. V.S. Vyas asserts **_the current land utilisation is non-viable. As population pressure increases efficient land utilisation is a must as no more land can be turned for agriculture by clearing the forest._**

The share of agricultural land is already huge and it cannot be sustainably increased anymore. So the productivity of agriculture must be increased to meet future demand. Demand for pasture land is also increasing so as to raise the production of animal husbandry, but forest clearance is not possible to increase the pasture land and agricultural land. So short-term and long-term plans, to increase productivity and reduce the share of barren land, must be taken in order to meet the future demand.

### Social erosion and soil conservation

When soil erosion occurs, it can cause a loss of topsoil, which contains many of the nutrients necessary for plant growth. This can lead to decreased crop yields, reduced biodiversity, and diminished soil quality. When eroded soil is carried by water or wind, it can end up in streams and rivers, causing sedimentation that can harm aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, soil erosion can lead to increased water runoff, which can cause flooding and water pollution. Waterlogging and consequent salinity in irrigated areas have also caused considerable damage to agricultural lands. For instance, the increased cultivation of rice leads to increased irrigation of water and it causes an increase in the salinity of the groundwater which now had to be converted to shrimp farms.

To mitigate the impact of soil erosion on natural resources, it is crucial to take steps to prevent erosion from occurring. This can include implementing conservation tillage practices, planting cover crops, and using erosion control structures such as grassed waterways or terraces. By taking these steps, it is possible to reduce soil erosion and protect the natural resources that depend on healthy soil. Ravines are deep and narrow gorges or valleys that are formed by the erosion of soil by water, wind or other natural processes. The management of ravines is an important part of soil conservation efforts, as they can cause significant damage to natural resources and the ecosystem. Various measures, such as the construction of check dams, contour bunds and vegetative cover, are employed to prevent soil erosion and to reclaim the land affected by ravines.

The Central Soil Conservation Board (CSCB) is an apex advisory body on issues related to soil and water conservation in India. It was established in 1952 under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The main objective of the CSCB is to promote scientific methods of soil and water conservation across the country. It advises the government on various issues related to soil and water conservation, and also provides technical guidance and support to various state governments, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders involved in soil and water conservation activities. The CSCB also coordinates and monitors various soil and water conservation programs and projects implemented by the government and other agencies.

## Water resources

Water resources include surface water, such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, as well as groundwater, which is found below the Earth's surface. The FAO classifies a region or a country as water-stressed when the annual water availability per capita is less than 1,700 cubic meters, and as water-scarce when it falls below 1,000 cubic meters per capita. **_Anju Gaur and Priyane Amerasinghe_** argue that, _at the macro level, India is in a water-stressed state._ 

**Surface water:** The entire surface water can be utilised because of topography, water flow characteristics, soil conditions and climate. In 1974 the surface water utilisation was about 25 million hectares meters and it is expected to increase to 70 million hectares meters in 2025. 

**Groundwater:** It accounts for about 40% of the country's total water supply and is used extensively in agriculture, industry, and domestic sectors. However, due to over-extraction and mismanagement, many regions in India are facing a groundwater crisis. 

The **Central Ground Water Board (CGWB**) is responsible for monitoring, assessing, and managing the groundwater resources in the country. Various measures have been taken by the government, including regulation of groundwater extraction, rainwater harvesting, and recharge of aquifers to address the groundwater crisis.

### National water policy

The National Water Policy is a policy document formulated by the Government of India to deal with the management and conservation of water resources in the country. The policy aims to ensure the optimal utilization of water resources in the country while maintaining its quality and protecting it from pollution. It also seeks to ensure the equitable distribution of water resources among different regions, sectors, and user groups. The policy was first formulated in 1987 and has since been updated several times, with the latest version being released in 2012. The policy provides the framework for the development and management of water resources in the country, and it is implemented by the central and state governments through various programs and schemes.

The key objectives of the NWP 2012 include:

1. Ensuring water security for all: The policy aims to ensure adequate and equitable water supply for all human activities while ensuring the sustainability of water resources.
2. Efficient water use: The policy promotes efficient water use through measures such as rainwater harvesting, water conservation, and reuse of wastewater.
3. Integrated water resources management: The policy emphasizes the need for integrated water resources management to ensure sustainable and equitable use of water resources.
4. Participatory approach: The policy emphasizes the importance of involving all stakeholders, including the public, in the management of water resources.
5. Pricing and regulation: The policy advocates the need for appropriate pricing and regulation of water use to ensure optimal allocation and efficient use of water resources.
6. Inter-state and international cooperation: The policy recognizes the need for cooperation and coordination among states and with neighbouring countries for the optimal management of water resources.
