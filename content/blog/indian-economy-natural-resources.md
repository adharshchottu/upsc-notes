**_Resources are generally defined as all those things available in man's physical environment on which he depends for the satisfaction of some want or the other._**

**W. A. Lewis** states _"the level and pattern of development of a country is often limited by its natural resources"_

## Land resources

The **National Forest Policy Resolution** of the Government of India in 1952 recommended that considering the need for ecological balance, the country should have one-third of land as forest cover. But we are not able to reach the target even now.

The land that is not available for cultivation is of two categories. _land put to non-agricultural uses_ and _barren land_. Over the years barren land was reduced and due to population pressure some uncultivable land was made cultivable. Land with trees and groves has been reduced and is being replaced by agriculture. Agriculture land increased over the years. V.S. Vyas asserts **_the current land utilisation is non-viable. As population pressure increases efficient land utilisation is a must as no more land can be turned for agriculture by clearing the forest._**

The share of agricultural land is already huge and it cannot be sustainably increased anymore. So the productivity of agriculture must be increased to meet the future demand. Demand for pasture land is also increasing so as to raise the production of animal husbandry, but forest clearance is not possible to increase the pasture land and agricuurwe land. So short-term and long-term plans, to increase the productivity and reduce the share of barren land, must be taken in order to meet the future demand.
