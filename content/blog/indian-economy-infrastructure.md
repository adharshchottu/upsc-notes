**_The development of infrastructure is a sine qua non of economic development._**

## Power or Electricity

India has a rapidly expanding power infrastructure that includes a mix of conventional and renewable energy sources. There are a number of problems in the electricity sector:

1. Insufficient generation capacity: There is a gap between the demand and supply of electricity in the country, leading to power shortages and load shedding.
2. The poor financial health of state electricity boards (SEBs): Many SEBs are facing losses due to factors like low tariffs, high transmission and distribution losses, and non-payment of dues by customers.
3. High transmission and distribution losses: Due to the poor condition of the transmission and distribution network, a significant amount of electricity is lost during transmission and distribution.
4. Inadequate rural electrification: Many villages in India still do not have access to electricity, and the electrification rate in rural areas is lower than in urban areas.
5. Dependence on fossil fuels: India is heavily dependent on fossil fuels like coal and oil for power generation, which has negative environmental impacts and is vulnerable to price fluctuations.
6. Lack of energy efficiency: There is a lack of awareness and incentives for energy efficiency measures, which leads to the wastage of energy.
7. Non-uniform pricing: Electricity tariffs vary significantly across states, which can lead to market inefficiencies and distortions.

The **Electricity Act, of 2013** is an Indian legislation that governs the generation, transmission, distribution, and trading of electricity in the country. It replaced the Electricity Act, of 2003 and aims to promote competition, rationalization of electricity tariffs, and the development of the power sector in a sustainable and socially responsible manner. The Act provides for the establishment of several regulatory bodies such as the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs), and the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (ATE) to regulate the sector and resolve disputes. It also provides for the establishment of the National Renewable Energy Policy and the National Renewable Energy Fund to promote the development of renewable energy sources in the country. Under the new statuary regime, generation of power is completely delicensed and captive power generation is freely allowed.

**Sources of power**

1. Hydel power: The share of hydel power is reduced in India. Its development depends on a lot of factors.
2. Thermal power: 75% of total power comes from thermal power. mainly coal but it is polluting and exhaustible.
3. Nuclear power: very little share
4. RES(renewable energy resources): solar power, wind power, biomass, etc

**Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY)** is a scheme launched by the Government of India in November 2015 to improve the financial and operational performance of power distribution companies (DISCOMs) in India. The scheme aims to reduce the debt burden of the DISCOMs and improve their efficiency through measures such as reducing transmission and distribution losses, improving billing and collection efficiency, and promoting energy efficiency. Under UDAY, state governments take over 75% of the debt of the DISCOMs, and the remaining debt is issued as state-backed DISCOM bonds. The scheme also provides financial incentives to DISCOMs for meeting operational and financial targets.

## Coal

Coal is the major source of energy in India. Coal deposits are chiefly found in Jharkhand, Odisha, Chattisgarh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Andra Pradesh and Maharastra. Government strive to make coal production environment-friendly through the use of modern mining equipment and the restoration of old mines to their original state.

**Coal gasification** is a process that converts coal into a cleaner-burning gas. The process involves reacting coal with oxygen, steam, and carbon dioxide to produce a gas that can be used for power generation or other industrial purposes. One of the main advantages of coal gasification is that it allows for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide, which can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the process can be expensive and requires a significant amount of energy to operate. Additionally, the production of syngas from coal gasification still produces emissions of other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The Indian government has launched various initiatives to promote the adoption of coal gasification technology, such as the **_Coal Gasification Mission_**, which aims to set up coal gasification projects across the country.

## Oil and Gas

Proven oil reserves are very low but the dependence on oil is high in India. This results in huge imports thus a balance of payment crisis and vulnerability to global price fluctuations. Major reforms have taken place in this sector post-independence:

1. Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) was established to explore and exploit oil and gas resources in India in 1956
2. In 1976, the Oil Industry (Development) Act was passed, which led to the nationalization of major oil companies such as IOC, BPCL and HPCL.
3. Introduction of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 1997, which provided a framework for private and foreign companies to explore and produce oil and gas in India.
4. Market-determined price for all petroleum products except PDS kerosene and domestic LPG.
5. Allowing domestic companies to acquire international oil and gas reserves. for instance ONGC Videsh Ltd, GAIL global, etc
6. Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy 2015, to replace NELP, to simplify the process for obtaining exploration and production licenses and to provide a transparent and competitive bidding process.

**Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP)**: It was introduced in 2016 to simplify the process of oil and gas exploration and production, as well as attract more investment in the sector. The policy replaced the previous NELP and introduced a revenue-sharing model between the government and the companies involved in exploration and production. The policy also introduced the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) which allows companies to choose the blocks they want to explore and produce from, as opposed to the previous system of government allocation. Allowed market-determined prices for petroleum products.

## Atomic energy

India's atomic energy program started in 1948 with the formation of the Atomic Energy Commission. In 1954, the Atomic Energy Act was passed which gave the Atomic Energy Commission the power to carry out research, build reactors and mines, and produce and use atomic energy for peaceful purposes. India conducted its first nuclear test, code-named "Smiling Buddha," in 1974, which made it the first country outside of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to possess nuclear weapons. Currently, India's nuclear power sector generates about 3% of the country's electricity. Uranium and Thorium are the fuels used in nuclear reactors.

**Nuclear fuel cycle**: series of processes involved in the production of nuclear power. the steps include:

1. mining and processing of uranium ore
2. enriching to increase the concentration of fissile isotopes
3. the fabrication of fuel rods
4. the operation of nuclear reactors
5. the reprocessing of spent fuel
6. the disposal of nuclear waste

**Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL)**: a government-owned company that is responsible for the generation of nuclear power for electricity purposes in India. It was created in September 1987 under the Companies Act 1956, and it operates several nuclear power plants across India. NPCIL is a public sector enterprise under the administrative control of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). Its headquarters are located in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

## Energy strategy

India's per capita reserves for coal and petroleum are very low compared to US and china. The heavy dependence on energy import will result in volatility and will act as a hindrance towards economic growth and thus economic development. 

1. Accelerated exploitation of domestic conventional energy sources
2. management of oil demand
3. substitution of natural gas for oil products
4. energy conservation
5. exploitation of new renewable sources of energy like solar energy, wind energy and biogas
6. intensification of research and development in emerging energy technologies

The **Integrated Energy Policy (IEP)** was introduced by the Government of India in 2008 with the objective of providing a long-term roadmap for India's energy security. The policy aimed to develop a diversified fuel mix that includes coal, oil, gas, nuclear, and renewable energy sources. It also proposed measures for energy conservation and the development of energy-efficient technologies. The IEP laid out a comprehensive strategy for achieving energy security, sustainability, and equity while addressing the challenges of climate change and global warming.
