## Historical underpinnings

The historical underpinnings of the Indian Constitution can be traced back to several sources, including the country's ancient legal and political traditions, as well as more recent constitutional developments in British India and other countries.

The Indian Constitution was heavily influenced by the British parliamentary system, as well as the legal and constitutional practices of the United States, Canada, and other Commonwealth countries. The Indian Constitution also draws on the principles of the French Revolution, particularly the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

The Indian Constitution also incorporates many elements of India's ancient legal and political traditions, such as the rule of law and the separation of powers. The Constitution also reflects the values of the Indian independence movement, which emphasized the need for a secular, democratic and socialist republic.

The Indian Constitution also contains references to various social and economic rights and directive principles, which are considered to be a reflection of the country's history of social and economic inequality and the need for social reform.

Furthermore, Indian Constitution also incorporates many provisions from the Indian Independence Act 1947, Government of India Act 1935, Indian Council Act 1861 and 1892, Indian Council Act 1909, Minto-Morley Reforms, Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, Simon Commission Report, White Paper on Indian Constitutional Reforms, Cabinet Mission Plan and Nehru Report.

### Regulating act of 1773

It was a British law passed to reform and regulate the administration of the East India Company. The act was passed in response to a series of crises in India, including the Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the East India Company's army defeated the forces of the Nawab of Bengal, and the Bengal Famine of 1770, which resulted in the deaths of millions of people. The act established a new system of government for India, with a **Governor-General** and Council appointed by the British government to govern the company's territories. The act also established a **Supreme Court** in Calcutta, which had jurisdiction over all British subjects in India, and it required the company to submit annual accounts to the British government. The act was significant as it marked the beginning of British government control over India, and it laid the foundation for the eventual establishment of the British Raj.

### The Pitt's India Act of 1784

The act aimed to address the problems that arose after the Regulating Act of 1773. The act established a new system of government for India, with a **Board of Control** appointed by the British government to oversee the company's affairs and to supervise the Governor-General and Council in India. The act also established a new system of financial accountability for the company, with the requirement that the company's revenues be paid into the British Treasury, and the company's expenses are approved by the Board of Control. This act was significant as it marked a major step in the process of transferring control of India from the East India Company to the British government.

### Charter act of  1833

It played a key role in the constitutional history of India by transferring power to the **British Crown**, laying the foundation for the British Raj, and establishing the foundations for a **centralized administration** and **Western-style education system** in India. This ultimately led to the emergence of a Western-educated Indian elite, who would play a significant role in the Indian independence movement. The act also made provision for the appointment of a **Governor-General of India** and the creation of a legislative council, which had the power to make laws for British India, but did not include any Indian representatives.

### Act of 1858

The Act of 1858, also known as the Government of India Act 1858, is considered a significant event in the constitutional history of India, as it marked the **end of the East India Company's rule** and the beginning of the British Raj, where the British Crown directly controlled and governed India through the **Viceroy of India** and the **Secretary of State for India**.

### Government of India Act 1861

It allowed for greater Indian participation in the administration of British India and marked the beginning of a process of gradual constitutional reform that would continue throughout the British Raj. Unfortunately, the non-official Indian members appointed to the councils were still a minority and did not have any real power to influence the decisions.

### Indian Councils Act 1892

The act expanded the membership of the Governor-General's executive council and the legislative councils in the presidencies of Bengal, Bombay, and Madras, and created new legislative councils in other provinces.

### The Indian Councils Act of 1909

Also known as the **Morley-Minto Reforms**, was an act of the British Parliament that aimed to increase the participation of Indians in the governance of British India. The act **expanded** the membership of the Imperial Legislative Council and the provincial councils and allowed for the election of some members, in addition to the appointment of members by the British government. It was the first legislation that introduced **communal representation** through separate electorates for Muslims, which created a separate Muslim electorate and reserved seats for Muslims in the legislative councils. This move further deepened the communal divide between Hindus and Muslims and is considered a major factor in the partition of India in 1947.

### Government of India Act of 1919

The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the **Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms**, was an act passed by the British Parliament that implemented the recommendations of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report. The act aimed to increase the participation of Indians in the governance of British India and to bring about constitutional reform. The Act introduced a system of **dyarchy** or dual government. The Act also extended the franchise, separated the executive and legislative branches of government, and established a **bicameral legislature** for British India, consisting of a Council of State and a Legislative Assembly. The Act received mixed reactions in India, it was seen as a step forward in constitutional reform, but it was criticized by Indian nationalists for not going far enough in granting Indians real political power and for perpetuating British control over vital areas of governance. The act of 1919 was an important step towards the self-governance of British India, but it did not provide the full autonomy that the Indians were demanding. Simon commission was set up as part of the act after 10 years to review the act and reform it if necessary.

### Government of India Act 1935

It aimed to further constitutional reform in British India and increase the participation of Indians in the governance of the country. The act was a result of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee, which was set up to review the working of the Government of India Act 1919. It established a **federal system** of government, with powers divided between the British government and the Indian provinces. The Act also provided for the creation of an independent public service commission and the separation of the judiciary from the executive. It extended the franchise and provided for the establishment of a bicameral legislature at the centre, consisting of a Council of States and a Federal Assembly. The act was not implemented in its entirety due to the outbreak of World War II and the political developments in India. The act endeavoured to give a written constitution to the country.
