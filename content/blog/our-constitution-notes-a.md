## Historical underpinnings

The historical underpinnings of the Indian Constitution can be traced back to several sources, including the country's ancient legal and political traditions, as well as more recent constitutional developments in British India and other countries.

The Indian Constitution was heavily influenced by the British parliamentary system, as well as the legal and constitutional practices of the United States, Canada, and other Commonwealth countries. The Indian Constitution also draws on the principles of the French Revolution, particularly the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

The Indian Constitution also incorporates many elements of India's ancient legal and political traditions, such as the rule of law and the separation of powers. The Constitution also reflects the values of the Indian independence movement, which emphasized the need for a secular, democratic and socialist republic.

The Indian Constitution also contains references to various social and economic rights and directive principles, which are considered to be a reflection of the country's history of social and economic inequality and the need for social reform.

Furthermore, Indian Constitution also incorporates many provisions from the Indian Independence Act 1947, Government of India Act 1935, Indian Council Act 1861 and 1892, Indian Council Act 1909, Minto-Morley Reforms, Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, Simon Commission Report, White Paper on Indian Constitutional Reforms, Cabinet Mission Plan and Nehru Report.

### Regulating act of 1773

It was a British law passed to reform and regulate the administration of the East India Company. The act was passed in response to a series of crises in India, including the Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the East India Company's army defeated the forces of the Nawab of Bengal, and the Bengal Famine of 1770, which resulted in the deaths of millions of people. The act established a new system of government for India, with a **Governor-General** and Council appointed by the British government to govern the company's territories. The act also established a **Supreme Court** in Calcutta, which had jurisdiction over all British subjects in India, and it required the company to submit annual accounts to the British government. The act was significant as it marked the beginning of British government control over India, and it laid the foundation for the eventual establishment of the British Raj.

### The Pitt's India Act of 1784

The act aimed to address the problems that arose after the Regulating Act of 1773. The act established a new system of government for India, with a **Board of Control** appointed by the British government to oversee the company's affairs and to supervise the Governor-General and Council in India. The act also established a new system of financial accountability for the company, with the requirement that the company's revenues be paid into the British Treasury, and the company's expenses are approved by the Board of Control. This act was significant as it marked a major step in the process of transferring control of India from the East India Company to the British government.

### Charter act of  1833

It played a key role in the constitutional history of India by transferring power to the **British Crown**, laying the foundation for the British Raj, and establishing the foundations for a **centralized administration** and **Western-style education system** in India. This ultimately led to the emergence of a Western-educated Indian elite, who would play a significant role in the Indian independence movement. The act also made provision for the appointment of a **Governor-General of India** and the creation of a legislative council, which had the power to make laws for British India, but did not include any Indian representatives.

### Act of 1858

The Act of 1858, also known as the Government of India Act 1858, is considered a significant event in the constitutional history of India, as it marked the **end of the East India Company's rule** and the beginning of the British Raj, where the British Crown directly controlled and governed India through the **Viceroy of India** and the **Secretary of State for India**.

### Government of India Act 1861

It allowed for greater Indian participation in the administration of British India and marked the beginning of a process of gradual constitutional reform that would continue throughout the British Raj. Unfortunately, the non-official Indian members appointed to the councils were still a minority and did not have any real power to influence the decisions.

### Indian Councils Act 1892

The act expanded the membership of the Governor-General's executive council and the legislative councils in the presidencies of Bengal, Bombay, and Madras, and created new legislative councils in other provinces.

### The Indian Councils Act of 1909

Also known as the **Morley-Minto Reforms**, was an act of the British Parliament that aimed to increase the participation of Indians in the governance of British India. The act **expanded** the membership of the Imperial Legislative Council and the provincial councils and allowed for the election of some members, in addition to the appointment of members by the British government. It was the first legislation that introduced **communal representation** through separate electorates for Muslims, which created a separate Muslim electorate and reserved seats for Muslims in the legislative councils. This move further deepened the communal divide between Hindus and Muslims and is considered a major factor in the partition of India in 1947.

### Government of India Act of 1919

The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the **Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms**, was an act passed by the British Parliament that implemented the recommendations of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report. The act aimed to increase the participation of Indians in the governance of British India and to bring about constitutional reform. The Act introduced a system of **dyarchy** or dual government. The Act also extended the franchise, separated the executive and legislative branches of government, and established a **bicameral legislature** for British India, consisting of a Council of State and a Legislative Assembly. The Act received mixed reactions in India, it was seen as a step forward in constitutional reform, but it was criticized by Indian nationalists for not going far enough in granting Indians real political power and for perpetuating British control over vital areas of governance. The act of 1919 was an important step towards the self-governance of British India, but it did not provide the full autonomy that the Indians were demanding. Simon commission was set up as part of the act after 10 years to review the act and reform it if necessary.

### Government of India Act 1935

It aimed to further constitutional reform in British India and increase the participation of Indians in the governance of the country. The act was a result of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee, which was set up to review the working of the Government of India Act 1919. It established a **federal system** of government, with powers divided between the British government and the Indian provinces. The Act also provided for the creation of an independent public service commission and the separation of the judiciary from the executive. It extended the franchise and provided for the establishment of a bicameral legislature at the centre, consisting of a Council of States and a Federal Assembly. The act was not implemented in its entirety due to the outbreak of World War II and the political developments in India. The act endeavoured to give a written constitution to the country.

### Towards independence(1942-47)

* **Cripps mission**

  It was a diplomatic effort in 1942 by the British government to **secure Indian support for their war effort during World War II**. The mission was led by Sir **Stafford Cripps**, a British cabinet minister, and was intended to negotiate an agreement between the British government and Indian political leaders for Indian participation in the war. However, the **mission failed** as Indian leaders, particularly the Indian National Congress, rejected the proposal as it did not address their demand for full independence from British rule. The mission is significant in Indian history as it marked a significant setback in Anglo-Indian relations and further solidified the Indian independence movement.
* **Quit India Movement**

  Also known as the August Movement, was **a civil disobedience movement** launched in India in **1942** in response to **Mahatma Gandhi**'s call for immediate independence from British rule. The movement was launched at the height of World War II and called for the British to immediately leave India and transfer power to the Indians. The movement was marked by widespread acts of non-violent civil disobedience and strikes and was met with solid repression by the British government. Despite the harsh response, the movement is widely considered to have been a turning point in India's struggle for independence and played a significant role in pressuring the British to eventually leave India in 1947.
* **Wavell plan**

  It was a proposal put forth by British Field Marshal **Archibald Wavell in 1945** to address the political situation in British India, which was facing increasing demands for independence. The plan proposed the creation of a new executive council with equal numbers of Hindu and Muslim members, as well as representatives of other minorities, to serve as an advisory body to the British government. The plan also proposed the formation of a new British-Indian army, with equal representation of all communities, and the establishment of a joint defence council for India and Pakistan. The Wavell Plan was **rejected** by the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress and ultimately led to the partition of India and the creation of the independent states of India and Pakistan in 1947.
* **Simla conference**

  It was a meeting held in 1945 between the British Prime Minister **Clement Attlee**, and the leaders of the Indian independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. The conference was held in Simla, India, and its purpose was to discuss the transfer of power from British colonial rule to Indian independence. The conference **failed** to reach a resolution, and the British government later announced plans to divide British India into two separate countries, India and Pakistan.
* **Cabinet mission**

  It was a group of British politicians sent to India in 1946 to n**egotiate a political settlement** between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League and to finalize plans for the transfer of power from British colonial rule to Indian independence. The mission was headed by Lord Pethick-Lawrence, Secretary of State for India, and included Sir Stafford Cripps, a prominent Labour Party politician, and A. V. Alexander, First Lord of the Admiralty. The mission proposed a federal structure for independent India, but the proposals were **rejected** by both Congress and the Muslim League, leading to the eventual partition of India.
* **Interim government**

  The Interim Government of India was formed in 1946 as a result of negotiations between the British government and the Indian National Congress and Muslim League as part of the Cabinet Mission Plan. It was established as a transitional government to **oversee the transfer of power** from British rule to Indian independence. The government was headed by Jawaharlal Nehru as Prime Minister and included other key leaders. The Interim Government served for a period of about one year until the formation of the independent government of India on August 15, 1947.
* **Mountbatten plan**

  The Mountbatten Plan, also known as the June 3rd Plan, was a proposal for the partition of British India presented by Lord **Louis Mountbatten**, the last British Viceroy of India, to the British government in 1947. The plan proposed the division of British India into **two separate independent countries**: India and Pakistan. The plan was accepted by the British government, and India and Pakistan gained independence on August 15, 1947. The partition led to large-scale communal violence and forced migration, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

### Indian Independence Act of 1947

The Indian Independence Act of 1947 was an Act of the British Parliament that partitioned British India into the two independent Dominions of India and Pakistan. It was passed on July 18, 1947, and came into effect on August 15, 1947. The Act provided for the transfer of power from the British government to the government of India and Pakistan, and also made provisions for the division of British Indian territory, including the division of the British Indian Army, the Indian Civil Service, and other administrative services. The Act also provided for the abolition of the British Paramountcy, which had previously been the authority of the British government over the Indian princely states. It was a significant step in the process of Indian independence from British colonial rule.

This is due to it got reproduced a large portion of the _Government of India Act 1935_, constitution makers do not want to leave any doubts or issues in future, and also contains the constitutional provisions for states. It is also one of the most comprehensive constitutions, covering a wide range of topics such as the organization of the government, fundamental rights, directive principles of state policy, and the procedures for amending the Constitution. The size of the Indian Constitution reflects the diverse and complex nature of Indian society, and the need to provide for a wide range of rights and protections for citizens. Additionally, the Indian Constitution has been amended over 100 times since its adoption in 1950, which has added to its size and complexity.

## Making of the Constitution

The concept of a constituent assembly had always been linked with the growth of the national movement in India. In opposition to the 1919 Act, in 1922 it was Mahatma Gandhi who made the first definite reference to a constituent assembly even though without those words or under that particular name.

 1. In 1922, a joint meeting of members of the two houses of the central legislature was held in Simla which decided to call a convention for the framing of the constitution. (1919 act created the bicameral legislature at the central level)
 2. Under the presidentship of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, in April 1924, a "National Convention" was held and they drafted a "Commonwealth of India Bill".
 3. With slight amendments of a committee by all party conference held in January 1925, the bill was sent to an influential labour party member and was presented in the House of Commons. (The fate of the Bill was sealed due to the defeat of the Labour party at that time)
 4. In November 1927, the Simon Commission formed faced backlash due to there were no Indians in the review commission.
 5. The Motilal Nehru Report in 1928 was an important milestone in the Indian freedom struggle and helped to shape the future of the country. It set the stage for the drafting of the Indian Constitution and the establishment of a democratic and secular republic. It calls for dominion status for India, a federal government with limited powers, provincial governments with wide-ranging powers, fundamental rights, an independent judiciary, abolition of untouchability and the establishment of a secular state.
 6. A formal call for a constituent assembly was put forward by a Congress working committee in 1934. And also it reiterates a constituent assembly elected based on adult suffrage.
 7. After the failure of the Cripps mission no updates till world war 2 ended in 1945.
 8. As per the Cabinet Mission in 1945, a representative body consisting of members elected from the provincial assemblies and nominated by the princely states is formed as the constituent assembly.
 9. The constituent assembly started working on 9 December 1946 and the assembly became complete after the partition in 1947. The assembly was believed to be sovereign and representative.
10. The Objective Resolution was moved by Nehru on 13 December 1946 and finally adopted on 22 January 1947, which acts as the philosophy and guiding principle for the creation of the constitution.

The basic idea was to retain the fundamentals of our polity but also evolve with time. The constitution is not a complete break free from the colonial past, but a progressive one. For instance, institutions and conventions took along, because those were born on Indian soil and had the foundation, so they decided to grow from there, instead of a new one.
