## Historical underpinnings

The historical underpinnings of the Indian Constitution can be traced back to several sources, including the country's ancient legal and political traditions, as well as more recent constitutional developments in British India and other countries.

The Indian Constitution was heavily influenced by the British parliamentary system, as well as the legal and constitutional practices of the United States, Canada, and other Commonwealth countries. The Indian Constitution also draws on the principles of the French Revolution, particularly the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

The Indian Constitution also incorporates many elements of India's ancient legal and political traditions, such as the rule of law and the separation of powers. The Constitution also reflects the values of the Indian independence movement, which emphasized the need for a secular, democratic and socialist republic.

The Indian Constitution also contains references to various social and economic rights and directive principles, which are considered to be a reflection of the country's history of social and economic inequality and the need for social reform.

Furthermore, Indian Constitution also incorporates many provisions from the Indian Independence Act 1947, Government of India Act 1935, Indian Council Act 1861 and 1892, Indian Council Act 1909, Minto-Morley Reforms, Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, Simon Commission Report, White Paper on Indian Constitutional Reforms, Cabinet Mission Plan and Nehru Report.

### Regulating act of 1773

It was a British law passed to reform and regulate the administration of the East India Company. The act was passed in response to a series of crises in India, including the Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the East India Company's army defeated the forces of the Nawab of Bengal, and the Bengal Famine of 1770, which resulted in the deaths of millions of people. The act established a new system of government for India, with a **Governor-General** and Council appointed by the British government to govern the company's territories. The act also established a **Supreme Court** in Calcutta, which had jurisdiction over all British subjects in India, and it required the company to submit annual accounts to the British government. The act was significant as it marked the beginning of British government control over India, and it laid the foundation for the eventual establishment of the British Raj.

### The Pitt's India Act of 1784

The act aimed to address the problems that arose after the Regulating Act of 1773. The act established a new system of government for India, with a **Board of Control** appointed by the British government to oversee the company's affairs and to supervise the Governor-General and Council in India. The act also established a new system of financial accountability for the company, with the requirement that the company's revenues be paid into the British Treasury, and the company's expenses are approved by the Board of Control. This act was significant as it marked a major step in the process of transferring control of India from the East India Company to the British government.
