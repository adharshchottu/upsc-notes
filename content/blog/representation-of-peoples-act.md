### Introduction

The holding of free and fair elections is the *sine-qua-non* of democracy. To ensure the conduct of elections in free, fair and in an impartial manner, the constitution-makers incorporated **Part XV (Articles 324-329)** in the constitution and empowered Parliament to make laws to regulate the electoral process. The ***Election Commission of India (ECI)*** is the watchdog of free and fair elections in the country and Article 324 of the Constitution provides for its establishment. In this context, the Parliament has enacted the **Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1950** and **Representation of the People Act,1951**.

**Article 325** of the constitution ensures universal suffrage and provides that no person be ineligible for inclusion in, or to claim to be included in a special, electoral roll on grounds of religion, race, caste or sex. This make the necessecity to come up with the acts to regulate elections in India. The ECI as an independent constitutional authority was therefore brought into force from November 26th, 1949.
