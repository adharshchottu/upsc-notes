### Introduction

The holding of free and fair elections is the *sine-qua-non* of democracy. To ensure the conduct of elections in free, fair and in an impartial manner, the constitution-makers incorporated **Part XV (Articles 324-329)** in the constitution and empowered Parliament to make laws to regulate the electoral process. The ***Election Commission of India (ECI)*** is the watchdog of free and fair elections in the country and Article 324 of the Constitution provides for its establishment. In this context, the Parliament has enacted the **Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1950** and **Representation of the People Act,1951**.

**Article 325** of the constitution ensures universal suffrage and provides that no person be ineligible for inclusion in, or to claim to be included in a special, electoral roll on grounds of religion, race, caste or sex. This make the necessecity to come up with the acts to regulate elections in India. The ECI as an independent constitutional authority was therefore brought into force from November 26th, 1949.

**The Constitution (Nineteenth Amendment) Act, 1966**, nullified the tribunals in India and instead gave the authority to the High Court to hear the trial of election petitions. The abolition of tribunals and the restoring of their powers to the High Court proved to be a turning point in the matters having a connection with elections in India. This made the High Court superior and their hold stronger. It also amended Article 324, subclause (1) and accordingly the Election Commission is given the authority to supervise, direct, and oversee elections.The Representation of the People Act of 1951 was also modified and it rendered the electoral tribunalsâ€™ appointment and authority null and void. A special provision concerning the ability to appoint election tribunals for the adjudication of uncertainties and issues coming out of or concerning elections to Parliament and the Legislatures of States was eliminated.

**The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978**, repealed Article 19 (1) (f) and also took out Article 31(1) has been taken out of Part III and made a separate Article 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII. This amendment may have taken away the scope of speedy remedy under Article 32 for the violation of Right to Property because it is no more a Fundamental Right. Making it a legal right under the Constitution serves two purposes: Firstly, it gives emphasis to the value of socialism included in the preamble and secondly, in doing so, it conformed to the doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution.

**The Constitution (Sixty-first Amendment) Act, 1988**, reduced the voting age for elections for Indian citizens from 21 years to 18 years. The voting age for an Indian citizen was decided as 21 years on the basis of adult suffrage. In simple words, any person below the age of 21 was not allowed to cast a vote in the elections for the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assembly of each State. With the introduction of this Amendment, a chance was given to unrepresented youths to express their views and emotions out in the open, thus inspiring them to participate in the political process.
