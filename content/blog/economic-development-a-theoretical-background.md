**Ronald A Shearer** stated, _"The literature of social sciences is a testimony to the errors: unnecessary confusions and prolonged debates which can result from an ambiguity on the level of basic conceptualization"_

# The concept of economic growth

It may be defined as a rate of expansion that can move an underdeveloped country from a near-subsistence mode of living to substantially higher levels. In the case of developed economies, it is the continuation of existing growth rates.

Economic growth can be described in terms of greater **commercialisation of economic activities.**
