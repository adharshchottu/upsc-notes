**Ronald A Shearer** stated, _"The literature of social sciences is a testimony to the errors: unnecessary confusions and prolonged debates which can result from an ambiguity on the level of basic conceptualization"_

## The concept of economic growth

It may be defined as a rate of expansion that can move an underdeveloped country from a near-subsistence mode of living to substantially higher levels. In the case of developed economies, it is the continuation of existing growth rates.

Economic growth can be described in terms of greater **commercialisation of economic activities.**

* _Rise in GDP_ - GDP: total of products produced and services rendered in a financial year inside the territory
* _Rise is per capita product_ - instead of quantity produced the structural changes in the economy are crucial for economic growth.
  * **Charles Bettelheim** stated, _"the aim should be not quantitative change(large production) only, but qualitative change too(i.e., higher productivity of labour). Only on the basis of such qualitative change can an economy as a whole rise to higher level."_
