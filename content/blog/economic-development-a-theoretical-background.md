**Ronald A Shearer** stated, _"The literature of social sciences is a testimony to the errors: unnecessary confusions and prolonged debates which can result from an ambiguity on the level of basic conceptualization"_

## The concept of economic growth

It may be defined as a rate of expansion that can move an underdeveloped country from a near-subsistence mode of living to substantially higher levels. In the case of developed economies, it is the continuation of existing growth rates.

Economic growth can be described in terms of greater **commercialisation of economic activities.**

* _Rise in GDP_ - GDP: total of products produced and services rendered in a financial year inside the territory
* _Rise is per capita product_ - instead of quantity produced the structural changes in the economy are crucial for economic growth.
  * **Charles Bettelheim** stated, _"the aim should be not quantitative change(large production) only, but qualitative change too(i.e., higher productivity of labour). Only on the basis of such qualitative change can an economy as a whole rise to higher level."_

## The concept of economic development

**Mahbub ul Haq** stated, _"the problem of development must be defined as a selective attack on the worst forms of poverty. Development goals must be defined in terms of progressive reduction and eventual elimination of malnutrition, disease, illiteracy, squalor, unemployment and inequalities."_

**Charles P. Kindleberger** and **Bruce Herrick** argued, _"Economic development is generally defined to include improvements in material welfare, especially for persons with the lowest incomes, the eradication of mass poverty with its correlates of illiteracy, disease and early death, changes in the composition of inputs and outputs that generally include shift in the underlying structure of production away from agricultural towards industrial activities"_

**Dudely seers** put forward that the status of development of a country depends upon the answers to three basic questions:

1. Status of poverty?
2. Status of unemployment?
3. Status of inequality?

If reduction in all three from a higher level to a lower level means definitely the development has taken place.

**Jean Dreze** and **Amartya Sen** state, _"The opportunity to live the kind of lives that people value - and have reason to value - depends among other things on the nature and robustness of the environment. In this sense, development has to be environment-inclusive"_

Purely economic growth need not necessary to be **_trickle down_** to economic development.

**Jean Dreze** and **Amartya Sen** stated, _"Economic growth is indeed important, not for itself, but for what it allows a country to do with the resources that are generated, expanding both individual incomes and the public revenue that can be used to meet social commitments."_

**_Dualism_** - the coexistence of developed and underdeveloped sectors in a country's economy side-by-side. In such an economy, one sector or subsector experiences perceptible growth, while the rest of the economy does not.

## Economic Underdevelopment

**Occupational distribution and underdevelopment**: It is widely held that the countries in which the primary sector provides employment to a large proportion of the labour force, are underdeveloped.

**Low per capita income**: It can be an indicator of underdevelopment. An underdeveloped country is one in which per capita real income is low when compared to the USA, Western Europe, etc. But several Arab states have high GNP but still, there are poor and least developed communities.

**Poverty**: Development is a process involving the elimination of poverty, income inequalities and unemployment. Thus underdevelopment is a situation characterised by the worst kind of deprivation.

**Development potential**: **_Jacob Viner_** defines an underdeveloped country as one _"which has good potential prospects for using more capital or more labour or more available natural resources, or all of these, to support its population on a higher level of living, or if its per capita income level is already fairly high, to support a larger population on a not lower level of living."_

**_The Indian planning commission defines an underdeveloped country as "one which is characterised by the coexistence, in greater or less degree, of unutilised or underutilized manpower on the one hand, and of unexploited natural resources on the other."_**
