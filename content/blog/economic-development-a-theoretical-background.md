**Ronald A Shearer** stated, _"The literature of social sciences is a testimony to the errors: unnecessary confusions and prolonged debates which can result from an ambiguity on the level of basic conceptualization"_

## The concept of economic growth

It may be defined as a rate of expansion that can move an underdeveloped country from a near-subsistence mode of living to substantially higher levels. In the case of developed economies, it is the continuation of existing growth rates.

Economic growth can be described in terms of greater **commercialisation of economic activities.**

* _Rise in GDP_ - GDP: total of products produced and services rendered in a financial year inside the territory
* _Rise is per capita product_ - instead of quantity produced the structural changes in the economy are crucial for economic growth.
  * **Charles Bettelheim** stated, _"the aim should be not quantitative change(large production) only, but qualitative change too(i.e., higher productivity of labour). Only on the basis of such qualitative change can an economy as a whole rise to higher level."_

## The concept of economic development

**Mahbub ul Haq** stated, _"the problem of development must be defined as a selective attack on the worst forms of poverty. Development goals must be defined in terms of progressive reduction and eventual elimination of malnutrition, disease, illiteracy, squalor, unemployment and inequalities."_

**Charles P. Kindleberger** and **Bruce Herrick** argued, _"Economic development is generally defined to include improvements in material welfare, especially for persons with the lowest incomes, the eradication of mass poverty with its correlates of illiteracy, disease and early death, changes in the composition of inputs and outputs that generally include shift in the underlying structure of production away from agricultural towards industrial activities"_

**Dudely seers** put forward that the status of development of a country depends upon the answers to three basic questions:

1. Status of poverty?
2. Status of unemployment?
3. Status of inequality?

If reduction in all three from a higher level to a lower level means definitely the development has taken place.

**Jean Dreze** and **Amartya Sen** state, _"The opportunity to live the kind of lives that people value - and have reason to value - depends among other things on the nature and robustness of the environment. In this sense, development has to be environment-inclusive"_
