"Every law is an infraction of liberty."
\~ Jeremy Bentham
-----------------

Jeremy Bentham’s quote succinctly captures the tension between laws and individual freedom. Laws are essential for maintaining order and protecting society, but they can also limit personal liberty. It’s a delicate balance that societies grapple with throughout history. 

1. **Civil Disobedience and Freedom**:
   * Mahatma Gandhi, a prominent leader in India’s struggle for independence, practised civil disobedience as a way to challenge unjust laws. He believed that individuals had a moral duty to resist laws that violated basic human rights.
   * Gandhi’s Salt March in 1930 is a powerful example. British colonial laws imposed a monopoly on salt production, making it illegal for Indians to collect or sell salt. Gandhi led a peaceful march to the sea, where he symbolically collected salt, defying the law and asserting the right to freedom.
2. **Prohibition Era in the United States**:
   * During the Prohibition era (1920–1933), the 18th Amendment banned the production, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. While intended to curb social problems, it led to unintended consequences.
   * Speakeasies (illegal bars) flourished, organized crime increased, and citizens faced restricted personal liberty. Many argued that the law infringed upon their right to make personal choices about alcohol consumption.
3. **The Nuremberg Laws (1935)**:
   * The Nuremberg Laws were a series of anti-Semitic laws enacted by Nazi Germany. They restricted the rights of Jewish citizens, including their ability to marry non-Jews, own property, and participate in public life.
   * These laws exemplify how legal frameworks can systematically infringe upon individual liberties based on ethnicity or religion.
4. **Japanese Internment during World War II**:
   * After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States forcibly relocated over 120,000 Japanese Americans (two-thirds of whom were native-born citizens) to internment camps.
   * While justified as a wartime security measure, it violated the civil rights and freedoms of innocent individuals based on their ancestry.
5. **The Patriot Act (2001)**:
   * In response to the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, granting extensive surveillance powers to law enforcement agencies.
   * Critics argue that it eroded privacy rights and civil liberties, leading to debates about the balance between security and individual freedom.
6. **Section 377 in India (repealed in 2018)**:
   * Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code criminalized consensual homosexual acts. It was a colonial-era law that persisted for decades.
   * The Supreme Court of India eventually struck down this law, recognizing the right to privacy and individual autonomy.
