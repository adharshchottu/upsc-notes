## Union Executive

Part V (The Union) under Chapter I (The Executive)

### President

Article 52 states that there shall be a President of India. The President is considered the Executive head of the country. All the Executive business of the country is carried out in the name of the President. The President is also the formal head of the executive, legislature and judiciary of India and the commander-in-chief of the Indian Armed Forces. However, in practice, most of the executive powers are exercised by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers on behalf of the President. 

Article 53 states that the executive power of the Union shall be vested in the President and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. It also states that the supreme command of the Defence Forces of the Union shall be vested in the President and the exercise thereof shall be regulated by law. However, this article does not transfer to the President any functions conferred by any existing law on the Government of any State or other authority, nor does it prevent Parliament from conferring by law functions on authorities other than the President.

Article 54 states that the President shall be elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States and Union Territories. The term “State” in this article includes the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union Territory of Puducherry. The election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote and the voting is by secret ballot.

Article 55 states that as far as practicable, there shall be uniformity in the scale of representation of the different States at the election of the President. It also states that for the purpose of securing such uniformity among the States and parity between the States and the Union, the number of votes which each elected member of Parliament and of the Legislative Assembly of each State is entitled to cast at such election shall be determined by a formula given in the article. The formula takes into account the population of each State (as per the 1971 census) and the number of elected members of each House of Parliament and each State Legislative Assembly. The election of the President shall be held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote and the voting at such election shall be by secret ballot.

The Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, of 1952 and the rules framed thereunder regulate all matters relating to the election of President and Vice-President. It was amended in 1974 and 1997.

Article 56 states that the President shall hold office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters his office. It also states that the President may resign his office by writing under his hand addressed to the Vice-President. The President may also be removed from his office by impeachment for violation of the Constitution. The President shall not be eligible for re-election to that office more than once.

Article 57 states that a person who holds, or who has held, office as President shall, subject to the other provisions of this Constitution, be eligible for re-election to that office. This means there is no bar on the number of times a person can be elected as President, as long as he or she fulfils the other qualifications and conditions laid down in the Constitution. However, no person has been elected as President for more than two terms so far in India.

Article 58 deals with the qualifications for election as President. It states that no person shall be eligible for election as President unless he or she is a citizen of India, has completed the age of thirty-five years, and is qualified for election as a member of the House of the People. It also states that a person shall not be eligible for election as President if he or she holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments.

Article 59 states that the President shall not be a member of either House of Parliament or of a House of the Legislature of any State, and if a member of either House of Parliament or of a House of the Legislature of any State is elected President, he or she shall be deemed to have vacated his or her seat in that House on the date on which he or she enters upon his or her office as President. It also states that the President shall not hold any other office of profit. The President shall be entitled without payment of rent to the use of his or her official residences and shall be also entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by Parliament by law and until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are specified in the Second Schedule. The emoluments and allowances of the President shall not be diminished during his or her term of office.

Article 60 deals with the oath or affirmation by the President. It states that every President and every person acting as President or discharging the functions of the President shall, before entering upon his office, make and subscribe in the presence of the Chief Justice of India or, in his absence, the senior-most Judge of the Supreme Court available.

Article 61 deals with the procedure for impeachment of the President. It states that when a President is to be impeached for violation of the Constitution, the charge shall be preferred by either House of Parliament. If as a result of the investigation a resolution is passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the House by which the charge was investigated or caused to be investigated, declaring that the charge preferred against the President has been sustained, such resolution shall have the effect of removing the President from his office as from the date on which the resolution is so passed.

Article 62 states that an election to fill a vacancy caused by the expiration of the term of office of President shall be completed before the expiration of the term. It also states that an election to fill a vacancy in the office of President occurring by reason of his death, resignation or removal, or otherwise shall be held as soon as possible after, and in no case later than six months from, the date of occurrence of the vacancy. The person elected to fill the vacancy shall, subject to the provisions of Article 56, be entitled to hold office for the full term of five years from the date on which he enters his office.

Article 70 is about the discharge of the President’s functions in other contingencies. It states that "Parliament may make such provision as it thinks fit for the discharge of the functions of the President in any contingency not provided for in this Chapter." This means that Parliament can enact laws to define the President’s duties and responsibilities in situations that are not covered by the other articles in this Chapter.

Article 71 is about the matters relating to, or connected with, the election of a President or Vice-President. It states that "All doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President or Vice-President shall be inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision shall be final." It also states that "If the election of a person as President or Vice-President is declared void by the Supreme Court, acts done by him in the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of the office of President or Vice-President, as the case may be, on or before the date of the decision of the Supreme Court shall not be invalidated by reason of that declaration." Furthermore, it states that "Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may by law regulate any matter relating to or connected with the election of a President or Vice-President." It also states that "The election of a person as President or Vice-President shall not be called in question on the ground of the existence of any vacancy for whatever reason among the members of the electoral college electing him."

Article 72 is about the power of the President to grant pardons, etc, and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases. It states that "The President shall have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence (a) in all cases where the punishment or sentence is by a Court Martial; (b) in all cases where the punishment or sentence is for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends; (c) in all cases where the sentence is a sentence of death." This means that the President can exercise his mercy power to reduce or waive off the penalty imposed on a person by a court of law, especially in cases involving the death penalty, military offences or offences against central laws. The President’s pardoning power is not absolute and should be exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers.

Article 77 states that "All executive action of the Government of India shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the President." This means that all orders, decisions, policies and actions of the Union Government are formally issued in the name of the President, who is the head of the executive. It also states that "Orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the President shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made by the President, and the validity of an order or instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the President." This means that all orders and instruments issued by the President have to be signed and verified by a designated officer or authority, and such authentication is sufficient proof of their validity and legality. Furthermore, It states that "The President shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of India and for the allocation among Ministers of the said business." This means that the President can frame rules and regulations for the smooth functioning and coordination of various ministries and departments of the Union Government and for the distribution of work among different Ministers. However, in practice, all these powers and functions of the President are exercised by him on the advice of the Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers, who are collectively responsible to Parliament.

### Vice-President

Article 63 states that "There shall be a Vice-President of India." The Vice President is chosen by the members of both Houses of Parliament in a joint session using a secret ballot and a single transferable vote in accordance with the proportional representation system. The Vice President serves for a five-year term but can continue to be in office, irrespective of the expiry of the term, until the successor assumes office.

Article 64 states that the Vice President’s role as the ex officio Chairman of the Council of States, also known as the Rajya Sabha. It states that "The Vice-President shall be ex officio Chairman of the Council of States and shall not hold any other office of profit".

Article 65 is about the Vice President’s role as the acting President or discharging the functions of the President during casual vacancies in the office, or during the absence, of the President. It states that "(1) In the event of the occurrence of any vacancy in the office of the President by reason of his death, resignation or removal, or otherwise, the Vice-President shall act as President until the date on which a new President elected in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter to fill such vacancy enters upon his office. (2) When the President is unable to discharge his functions owing to absence, illness or any other cause, the Vice-President shall discharge his functions until the date on which the President resumes his duties. (3) The Vice-President shall, during, and in respect of, the period while he is so acting as, or discharging the functions of, President, have all the powers and immunities of the President and be entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by Parliament by law and, until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are specified in the Second Schedule."

Article 66 states that "The Vice President shall be elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of the members of both Houses of Parliament in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote and the voting at such election shall be by secret ballot." It also states that "The Vice President shall not be a member of either House of Parliament or of a House of the Legislature of any State and if a member of either House of Parliament or of a House of the Legislature of any State is elected Vice President, he shall be deemed to have vacated his seat in that House on the date on which he enters upon his office as Vice President." Furthermore, it states that "No person shall be eligible for election as Vice President unless he (a) is a citizen of India; (b) has completed the age of thirty-five years; (c) is qualified for election as a member of the Council of States." It also states that "A person shall not be eligible for election as Vice President if he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments."

Article 67 is about the term of office of the Vice President. It states that "The Vice-President shall hold office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office." It also states that “a Vice-President may, by writing under his hand addressed to the President, resign his office” or “may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States passed by a majority of all the then members of the council and agreed to by the House of the People” with a notice of at least fourteen days. It also states that "a Vice-President shall, notwithstanding the expiration of his term, continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office."

Article 68 is about the time of holding an election to fill the vacancy in the office of Vice President and the term of office of the person elected to fill the casual vacancy. It states that "An election to fill a vacancy caused by the expiration of the term of office of Vice-President shall be completed before the expiration of the term." It also states that "An election to fill a vacancy in the office of Vice-President occurring by reason of his death, resignation or removal, or otherwise shall be held as soon as possible after the occurrence of the vacancy, and the person elected to fill the vacancy shall, subject to the provisions of article 67, be entitled to hold office for the full term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office."

Article 69 is about the oath or affirmation by the Vice President. It states that Every Vice-President shall, before entering upon his office, make and subscribe before the President, or some person appointed on that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation.

### The executive power of the Union

Article 73 states that "Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of the Union shall extend: (a) to the matters with respect to which Parliament has the power to make laws; and (b) to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by the Government of India by virtue of any treaty or agreement." This means that the President and his Council of Ministers can exercise their executive authority over all subjects that fall under the Union List or the Concurrent List, as well as over matters related to India’s foreign affairs and defence. However, the proviso to Article 73 states that "the executive power referred to in sub-clause (a) shall not, save as expressly provided in this Constitution or in any law made by Parliament, extend in any State to matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State also has the power to make laws." This means that the Union executive cannot interfere with the State executive in matters that fall under the State List or are within the exclusive domain of the State Legislature. It also states that "Until otherwise provided by Parliament, a State and any officer or authority of a State may, notwithstanding anything in this article, continue to exercise in matters with respect to which Parliament has the power to make laws for that State such executive power or functions as the State or officer or authority thereof could exercise immediately before the commencement of this Constitution." This means that until Parliament enacts a law on any subject that falls under its legislative competence, the existing executive arrangements in the States will continue.

### Council of Ministers

Article 74 states that "There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice." This means that the President is bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers, which is headed by the Prime Minister and represents the majority party or coalition in Parliament. However, the proviso to It states that "the President may require the Council of Ministers to reconsider such advice, either generally or otherwise, and the President shall act in accordance with the advice tendered after such reconsideration." This means that the President can send back the advice for reconsideration once, but if the Council of Ministers sends back the same advice, then the President has to accept it. The acceptance was made obligatory after the 42nd and 44th Amendments, but the Supreme Court had already made it binding in all its judgement even before the amendment. It also states that "The question whether any and if so what, advice was tendered by Ministers to the President shall not be inquired into in any court." This means that the advice given by the Council of Ministers to the President is confidential and cannot be challenged or scrutinized by the judiciary. But the Supreme Court can look into it if the government ever produce any report of the discussions.

There shall always be a council of ministers, there are no provisions for the president's rule at the Union level in case of failure of Constitutional machinery. Even after the dissolution of the Loksabha, the president shall continue to act on the Aid of the council of ministers. It was held by the Supreme Court in U.N. Rao vs Indira Gandhi in 1971, that any exercise of powers by the President without the advice of the Council of Ministers shall be unconstitutional as being violative of Article 74(1)

### Prime Minister

Article 75 states that "The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister." This means that the President has a formal role in appointing the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, but he has to act according to the will of the majority party or coalition in Parliament. It also states that "The Ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the President." This means that the President can remove any Minister from office at any time, but he has to act on the advice of the Prime Minister. Furthermore, It states that "The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People." This means that the Council of Ministers has to enjoy the confidence and support of the Lok Sabha, and if it loses a vote of no-confidence, it has to resign as a whole. It also states that "Before a Minister enters upon his office, the President shall administer to him the oaths of office and of secrecy according to the forms set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule." This means that every Minister has to take two oaths before assuming office: one to uphold the Constitution and faithfully discharge his duties, and another to not disclose any official secrets or information. Moreover, It states that "A Minister who for any period of six consecutive months is not a member of either House of Parliament shall at the expiration of that period cease to be a Minister." This means that every Minister has to be a member of either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and if he is not, he has to get elected or nominated within six months of his appointment. Finally, It states that "The salaries and allowances of Ministers shall be such as Parliament may from time to time by law determine and, until Parliament so determines, shall be as specified in the Second Schedule." This means that Parliament can fix or change the salaries and allowances of Ministers by passing a law, and until then, they will receive what is prescribed in the Second Schedule of the Constitution.

Article 78 is about the duties of the Prime Minister with respect to the furnishing of information to the President. It states that it shall be the duty of the Prime Minister: (a) to communicate to the President all decisions of the Council of Ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation; (b) to furnish such information relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as the President may call for; and (c) if the President so requires, to submit for the consideration of the Council of Ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by a Minister but which has not been considered by the Council. This means that the Prime Minister has to keep the President informed and consulted on all matters concerning the governance and legislation of the country, and also ensure that there is collective responsibility and coordination among his Ministers.

### Attorney General

Article 76 states that "The President shall appoint a person who is qualified to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court to be Attorney-General for India." This means that the Attorney-General is the highest law officer in India and a Union Executive member, who is appointed by the President on the basis of his legal expertise and experience. It also states that "It shall be the duty of the Attorney-General to give advice to the Government of India upon such legal matters, and to perform such other duties of a legal character, as may from time to time be referred or assigned to him by the President, and to discharge the functions conferred on him by or under this Constitution or any other law for the time being in force." This means that the Attorney-General is the chief legal adviser to the Union Government and assists it in all legal matters, such as drafting bills, ordinances, rules, regulations, etc. He also represents the Union Government in the Supreme Court and other courts where required. Furthermore, It states that "In the performance of his duties the Attorney-General shall have the right of audience in all courts in the territory of India." This means that the Attorney-General can appear and argue in any court of law in India, whether on behalf of the Union Government or any other party with its consent. It also states that "The Attorney-General shall hold office during the pleasure of the President, and shall receive such remuneration as the President may determine." This means that the Attorney-General can be removed by the President at any time without any reason, and his salary and allowances are fixed by the President.

## Union Legislature

Article 79 is about the Constitution of Parliament, which consists of the President and two Houses - the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and the House of People (Lok Sabha).

Article 80 is about the Composition of the Council of States, also known as the Rajya Sabha. It says that the Rajya Sabha has 12 nominated members and 238 elected members from the States and Union territories. The nominated members are experts in literature, science, art and social service. The representatives are chosen by different methods as per Article 80(4) and (5). Article 80(4) is about the election of the Rajya Sabha members by the State Legislatures using a single transferable vote system. This system allows voters to rank candidates and transfer votes to the next preference until a candidate gets a quota. Article 80(5) is about the election of the Rajya Sabha members from the Union territories. It says that the Parliament can make laws to decide how they are chosen.

The single transferable vote system and the first-past-the-post system are different ways of electing representatives. The single transferable vote system lets voters rank candidates and transfers their votes if their top choice is out or has extra votes. This system tries to make the results match the voters’ choices and elect multiple representatives from each area. The first-past-the-post system lets voters pick one candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins. This system is simple and clear and tends to produce strong governments. However, both systems have some problems. The single transferable vote system can be complicated and slow, and it may not produce stable results. The first-past-the-post system can be unfair and unrepresentative, and it may discourage smaller parties and cooperation.

Article 81 is about the Composition of the House of the People, also known as the Lok Sabha. It says that the Lok Sabha has 530 elected members from the States and 20 members from the Union territories. The seats are allocated according to the population as per the last census. Article 81(2) is about the allocation of seats in the House of the People to the States and Union territories. It says that each State should get a number of seats based on its population, and each State should be divided into constituencies based on its population. Article 81(3) is about how to calculate the population for allocating seats in the House of the People. It says that the population is based on the last census but with some exceptions. The exceptions are that until a new census is done and published after 2026, the population figures of 1971 and 2001 are used for different purposes. This means that the seats in the Lok Sabha are not updated according to the current population, but based on older data. The seat allocation is for till 2000, now it is being changed to 2026 via C(A)A,2001 and C(A)A,2003.

Article 82 is about how to change the seats in the House of the People based on the census. It says that after each census, the Parliament can make laws to change how many seats each State gets and how each State is divided into constituencies. The article also says that these changes will not apply until the current House ends, and that until a new census is done and published after 2026, the seats are based on the 1971 census.

Article 83 is about how long the two Houses of Parliament last. It says that the Council of States cannot be dissolved, but one-third of its members retire every two years. This means that the Rajya Sabha is always there, and its members have a term of six years. The article also says that the House of the People lasts for five years unless it is dissolved sooner, and then a new election must be held. This means that the Lok Sabha has a term of five years, but it can end earlier by the President or by losing confidence. The article also says that during an emergency, the Parliament can extend the term of the Lok Sabha by one year at a time, but not more than six months after the emergency is over. This means that during an emergency, the Lok Sabha can last longer than five years, but not too long.

Article 84 is about the qualification for membership in Parliament, which has two Houses - the Council of States and the House of People. It says that to be a member of Parliament, one must be an Indian citizen, take an oath or affirmation as per the Constitution, be at least thirty years old for Rajya Sabha and twenty-five years old for Lok Sabha, and meet any other criteria set by law. This means that these are the minimum requirements to be a member of Parliament.

Article 85  deals with the provisions of Sessions of Parliament, prorogation and dissolution. It states that: (1) The President shall from time to time summon each House of Parliament to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit, but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session. (2) The President may from time to time prorogue the Houses or either House; dissolve the House of the People.

Article 86 deals with the Right of the President to address and send messages to Houses. It states that: (1) The President may address either the House of Parliament or both Houses assembled together, and for that purpose require the attendance of members. (2) The President may send messages to either House of Parliament, whether with respect to a Bill then pending in Parliament or otherwise, and a House to which any message is so sent shall with all convenient despatch consider any matter required by the message to be taken into consideration.

Article 87 deals with the Special address by the President. It states that: (1) The President shall address both the Houses of Parliament assembled together at the start of the first session following each general election to the Lok Sabha and at the beginning of the first session of each year. (2) The President may send messages to either House of Parliament, whether with respect to a Bill then pending in Parliament or otherwise, and a House to which any message is so sent shall with all convenient despatch consider any matter required by the message to be taken into consideration.

Article 88 deals with the Rights of Ministers and Attorney-General as respects Houses. It states that: (1) Every Minister and the Attorney-General of India shall have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, either House, any joint sitting of the Houses, and any committee of Parliament of which he may be named a member, but shall not by virtue of this article be entitled to vote.

Article 89 deals with The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Council of States. It states that: (1) The Vice-President of India shall be ex officio Chairman of the Council of States. (2) The Council of States shall, as soon as may be, choose a member of the Council to be Deputy Chairman thereof and, so often as the office of Deputy Chairman becomes vacant, the Council shall choose another member to be Deputy Chairman thereof.

Article 90 deals with the Vacation and resignation of, and removal from, the office of Deputy Chairman. The Deputy Chairman of the Council of States shall vacate his office if he ceases to be a member of the Council. The Deputy Chairman may at any time, by writing under his hand addressed to the Chairman, resign his office. He may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council. No resolution for the purpose of removing the Deputy Chairman shall be moved unless at least fourteen days’ notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution.

Article 91 states that while the office of Chairman is vacant, or during any period when the Vice-President is acting as, or discharging the functions of, President, the duties of the office shall be performed by the Deputy Chairman, or, if the office of Deputy Chairman is also vacant, by such member of the Council of States as the President may appoint for the purpose. During the absence of the Chairman from any sitting of the Council of States, the Deputy Chairman, or, if he is also absent, such person as may be determined by the rules of procedure of the Council, or, if no such person is present, such other person as may be determined by the Council, shall act as Chairman.

Article 92 states that the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) shall not preside over the proceedings of the House while a resolution for his removal from office is under consideration. The Chairman shall have the right to speak and take part in the proceedings, but shall not vote on such resolution or any other matter during such proceedings.

Article 93 states that the House of the People shall choose two members of the House to be respectively Speaker and Deputy Speaker thereof and, so often as the office of Speaker or Deputy Speaker becomes vacant, the House shall choose another member to be Speaker or Deputy Speaker, as the case may be. The Speaker is the presiding officer of the Lok Sabha and exercises powers and functions as provided by the Constitution and the rules of procedure of the House. The Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker’s office when it is vacant or when the Speaker is absent from the sitting of the House.

Article 94 states that a member holding office as Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the House of the People shall vacate his office if he ceases to be a member of the House, may resign his office by writing to the Speaker or Deputy Speaker, as the case may be, and may be removed from his office by a resolution of the House passed by a majority of all the then members of the House. The article also provides that no resolution for removal shall be moved unless at least fourteen days' notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution and that the Speaker shall not vacate his office until immediately before the first meeting of the House after the dissolution.

Article 95 deals with the role and responsibility of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha if his office is vacant. It articulates the process and protocols for discharging the power and duties of the speaker in case the Speaker is not able to discharge his duties. The article states that while the office of Speaker is vacant, the duties of the office shall be performed by the Deputy Speaker or, if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant, by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose. The article also states that during the absence of the Speaker from any sitting of the House of the People, the Deputy Speaker or, if he is also absent, such person as may be determined by the rules of procedure of the House, or, if no such person is present, such other person as may be determined by the House, shall act as Speaker.

Article 96 talks about the conditions in which The Speaker has to work if his removal from the Lok Sabha is into consideration. The article states that at any sitting of the House of the People, while any resolution for the removal of the Speaker from his office is under consideration, the Speaker shall not preside, and the provisions of clause (2) of Article 95 shall apply in relation to every such sitting as they apply in relation to a sitting from which the Speaker is absent. The article also states that the Speaker shall have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, the House of the People while any resolution for his removal from office is under consideration in the House and shall be entitled to vote only in the first instance on such resolution or on any other matter during such proceedings but not in the case of an equality of votes.

Article 97 states that the salary and allowances of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the salary of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker can be decided by the Parliament by making a law for it. The amounts have been revised by various laws enacted by Parliament from time to time. According to the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954, as amended by the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Act, 2018. They are also entitled to various other allowances and facilities such as constituency allowance, office expense allowance, travelling allowance, free accommodation, medical facilities, etc.

Article 98 talks about the Secretariat of Parliament. It states that each House of Parliament shall have a separate secretarial staff, but this does not prevent the creation of posts common to both Houses of Parliament. The article also states that Parliament may by law regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to the secretarial staff of either House of Parliament. Until such provision is made by Parliament, the President may make rules for this purpose after consultation with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, as the case may be.

Article 99 talks about the oath or affirmation by members of Parliament. It states that every member of either House of Parliament shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the President, or some person appointed by him, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out in the Third Schedule of the Constitution. The Third Schedule of the Constitution contains the forms of oaths or affirmations for various constitutional offices, including the members of Parliament. 

Article 100 talks about the voting in Houses, the power of Houses to act notwithstanding vacancies and quorum. (1) states that all questions at any sitting of either House or joint sitting of the Houses shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting, except the Speaker or person acting as Chairman or Speaker. The Speaker or Chairman, or person acting as such, shall not vote in the first instance but shall have a casting vote in case of a tie.
