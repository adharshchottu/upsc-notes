## Man as a nomad

History gives us knowledge of the past. It tells us what went on in the world, and in our country, long before we were born. Knowledge of the past improves our knowledge of the present. We learn of the past from tools, pottery, coins, old buildings, inscriptions and old manuscripts. Some of the buildings, tools, pots and coins have to be dug out. Some of the languages and scripts in which manuscripts and inscriptions were written are no longer used.
