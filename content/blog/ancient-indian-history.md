## Man as a nomad

History gives us knowledge of the past. It tells us what went on in the world, and in our country, long before we were born. Knowledge of the past improves our knowledge of the present. We learn of the past from tools, pottery, coins, old buildings, inscriptions and old manuscripts. Some of the buildings, tools, pots and coins have to be dug out. Some of the languages and scripts in which manuscripts and inscriptions were written are no longer used.

In the beginning, the man was a nomad. He lived in caves or on leafy branches of trees and ate roots and fruits. In course of time, he learnt to make a fire and tools and weapons of stone. He hunted animals, ate their flesh, and in winter wrapped animal skins or leaves of trees around himself to keep warm. He wandered from place to place in groups. When he learnt to make his own tools and weapons, he took the first step towards civilization.

1. Manuscripts -> Hand-written ancient books
2. Inscriptions -> Writing that is engraved either on a stone surface or on metal or on bricks
3. Monuments -> Buildings belonging to the past, either dug out of the earth or found still standing
4. Script -> The forms of writing a language
5. Archaeological evidence -> Things that are dug out of the ground

## Beginnings of settled life

Primitive man was on the way to a civilized life when he discovered how to make a fire and tools from pieces of flint, and when he began to tame animals. Soon he learnt to grow grain. He also discovered metals. These discoveries were important. He stopped wandering, settled in one place and began to grow his food, make huts for shelter and make and use new tools and implements. The discovery of the wheel was a great help to early man. He could move from place to place more easily. He could also make better pottery. He made ornaments and learnt to make cloth. In the village, he felt the need for an organized life. Thus the nomads turned into a community with a fair amount of organization and division of work. They began to worship the sky and the sun and also the earth that provided food for them. Though the man had progressed, he did not yet know the art of writing.

1. Palaeolithic age(old stone age) -> The period when man used crude stone tools and weapons and led a nomadic life
2. Neolithic age(New stone age) -> The period when man used polished stone tools, domesticated animals, took to agriculture and led a settled life in villages
3. Chalcolithic age -> The transitional stage when both copper or bronze and stone tools and weapons were used and the man led a settled life. "Chalco" is a greek word and means copper.

## The cities

A new stage in civilization was reached with the growth of cities. In India, with the excavation of two ancient cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, a highly developed ancient civilization of five thousand years ago was laid bare. Recently several more cities with a similar way of life as Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro have been excavated at Rupar, Lothal and Kalibangan. This civilization is known as the Indus valley civilization or the Harappa culture. It extended over a vast area including Sind, Punjab, Rajasthan, Kathiawar and Gujarat. From the excavations, we know that this was a highly developed civilization. The cities were well-planned and properly looked after. The streets were well laid-out and had an efficient drainage system. The houses were well-planned. The people of this civilization had developed contact with people of other civilizations of that time in west Asia. The great bath is the best-known building in Mohenjo-Daro.

## The life of the people in the city

The articles that have been found in the various cities of the Harappa culture show that the people in those days led fairly advanced life. They were good builders, skilful craftsmen manufacturers, clever farmers and big traders. They manufactured cotton and woollen cloth. They were fond of ornaments. Their pottery was beautiful. They traded with the people of Sumer(Iran). They use precise weights and measures and perhaps marked their goods with seals. They knew how to write but their writings have not been read so far. They seemed to have worshipped the mother goddess and held the pipal tree and the bull sacred. They had many types of amusements and children has their toys. The fall of the Harappa culture was a sad event because the culture which followed was not as advanced as that of the Harappa people.

## The Aryan settlement

The Aryans came to India from North-eastern Iran and the region around the Caspian sea. At first, they settled in Punjab, and then some of them moved southeastwards into the region north of Delhi. Their further eastward expansion into the Ganga valley was made easier by the discovery of the use of iron. Our knowledge of the Aryans is based on literary evidence - hymns, poems, and stories which they composed. Aryan society was divided into tribes headed by chiefs or kings. Through the _samiti_ and the _sabha_, the king consulted the members of the tribe. The tribe was split into small units comprising a number of families living in villages. The Aryan family was a patriarchal family. 

When the Aryans came to India, they were a nomadic people. After they took to agriculture and settled down in villages, some of them began to specialize in certain crafts. This led to the exchange of goods between on village and another. The Aryans used horses which they had brought from Iran for drawing chariots.
